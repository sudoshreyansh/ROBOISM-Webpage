              “Apna safar, club ke is logo se lekar club ke in logon tak raha”.
              This single line, which was said by one of my RoboISM batchmates during our last club meet, accurately
              describes my entire journey with the club. From having a club without even a logo to seeing that same
              club bag gold at Inter-IIT Tech Meet, from working with a team of fewer than 15 members to growing into
              a 40 member strong fraternity, I consider myself fortunate for being able to witness and be a part of 
              this evolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Going back to 2015, a couple of months after I joined ISM Dhanbad, I had attended a basic robotics workshop
              organized by the robotics club. My seniors were demonstrating the blinking of an LED, using Arduino Uno.
              It does sound stupid, but that’s how my journey with RoboISM began. Till that point of time, I almost had
              no idea about robotics. I had learnt C programming in junior college, but actually seeing some hardware 
              respond to a program was absolutely fascinating for me. So, I went ahead and joined RoboISM. Getting
              selected wasn’t a big deal at all, back then, although these days, it has become a bit challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
              SAC 203 - A practically empty room with just some wooden scrap, malfunctioning
              electronic components and tangled electrical wires lying in one corner. Yes, that was RoboISM during my first year.
              In the second year, my batchmates and I started working towards improving the club. With only five club members left, 
              from my batch, it was indeed a tedious task. Firstly, we needed a logo, and we got a great design from the same person 
              who later designed the logo for FotoFreaks. Being a small team, the tasks of planning and conducting workshops, guiding 
              juniors, organizing robotics events in Concetto, and continually pushing the college administration for permissions 
              and facilities, left us with very little time for working on our skills and projects. So, I began using the preparation 
              time for exams for developing my projects. That did take a toll on my academic performance, but the sacrifice was worth 
              it. Academics v/s club activities remains a debatable topic. For me, RoboISM came above everything else. But still, 
              I maintained a decent GPA of around 8.4 because that too is important in its own ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the third year, the club had begun to show signs of improvement. We now had an energetic and efficient team 
              of sophomores and some brilliant freshers, who were way more skilled than us. Also that year, the robotics in 
              Concetto events reached new heights. Lack of funding was still an issue, but that too got solved in my final year. 
              Our juniors secured approval from the institute to purchase several robotics components, and RoboISM was also 
              assigned a bigger club room (SAC 207). That year, we again got another amazing set of freshers, and as an icing on 
              the cake, some members of the club also won a gold medal at Inter-IIT Tech Meet. Of course, there was still more to 
              do, but having things fall into place during my last year at the club was the best farewell I could get.
            </p>
            <p>
              RoboISM has been instrumental in the choice of my career. Robotics itself is a vast field, and understanding its 
              subdomains is crucial. Being a part of a like-minded peer group helped me gain exposure to many spheres without 
              diving deep into them myself. During the second and third year, I explored a variety of fields like steganography, 
              computer vision, robotic manipulation, embedded systems, and IR communication. That’s how I realized that embedded 
              systems are my true passion. I feel that the first three years of engineering are the ones for finding which domain 
              works well for you. That is the time for making wrong decisions, learning from them and rectifying your choices 
              accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the end of the final year, none of my applications for higher studies had succeeded. And I did not have a job 
              offer either. However, the projects developed at the club, and the technical skills acquired, had built a strong 
              profile for me. I started looking for a job after I left college, and within a month, I managed to receive two 
              offers. RoboISM had fostered my knowledge to such an extent, that things went good even though I didn’t have much 
              time to prepare for the interviews. That’s one excellent thing about the club. In the process of discussing with 
              your peers and teaching juniors, you unknowingly strengthen your understanding. Sometimes, juniors raise doubts 
              which force you to think in a new direction. RoboISM has helped me recognise that teaching is the best way of 
              learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I started working in the embedded systems industry, I realised that the technologies in use and the level 
              of products were much superior to those which I had worked on, at RoboISM. But, even though the knowledge and 
              experience gained at the club did not meet industry standards, it still is very much necessary. It helped me a 
              great deal in quickly getting acquainted with more advanced systems. It has been correctly said that the secret 
              of getting ahead is getting started. And RoboISM provided me with that essential kickstart.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, this is for the present club members. In 2016, when we decided to uplift the club, I was well aware that 
              this process could take years and I might graduate before witnessing it. As times changed, the next batches had 
              different goals than ours. But at the end of the day, we all wanted to make the club a better place for future 
              students. We did not want you guys to face the problems which we went through. Of course, as the club progresses, 
              there are always going to be new difficulties. At times, you might lose hope or feel like giving up. That 
              is when you need to give it a moment and think, “Is the club better today, than it was at the time I joined 
              this college?” If the answer is yes, which would most likely be the case, then that definitely is a success. 
              Instead of quitting, you need to navigate the club through those hurdles and be ready to face the next set of 
              challenges. Always have faith in RoboISM and its family, serve it with your heart and soul, and think beyond infinity!!

              <h1>My 1st year with RoboISM</h1>
              <p>After joining an engineering college, the first thing that I dreamt was making robots, exploring the automaticity, making machinery to ease human work load, etc. but, when I entered the first lecture it was full of boring stuff, I was fed up of,  the morning lab work and evening lectures. Thereafter, ROBOISM was a dream come true for me. ROBOISM- robotics and AI Club of IIT ISM Dhanbad, is the place where all the students of our college learn robotics, and make some awesome robots.</p>
              <p> In the club we get great environment for learning different topics such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc. We get great support from our seniors in every form, whether it’s an error in an Arduino code, or it can be related to career options. From making the first RC bot for the selection in the Club to representing college though club, the journey has been beautiful. The environment inside club is great; senior-junior relation is very healthy. Before joining the club I didn’t have any knowledge in robotics, but after getting regular session for our seniors on different topics I could learn the things. So, at roboism I found the things, that I wanted to learn, also I a way, that I wanted.</p>

              <h1>Concetto</h1>
              <p>With a theme of “To the moon and back” Concetto’19 not only put the college on skates but also created a hubbub in the city. Of course, it was natural as it was to provide a turf to 300 colleges from all over India to showcase their technical prowess. Before the commencement of the gala the whole college knuckled down to its best. Every single person in the college was pumped up for the largest Techno-management fest of eastern India and all the charm it was to bring with it. </p>
              <p>The college was decorated as a bride. The largesse of events was bestowed upon us. Encompassing the various boundaries of science and technology, Concetto’19 was there with 45 events in all, providing a platform to shoot the "TECHNICAL ME" of everyone. Every department had something to offer to in the plethora of events. And then came the clubs which took things to a whole different dimension. Especially the Robotics and AI club of the college ROBOISM. The highest rewarding in terms of cash prize and the “wow” factor, the robotics events of Robowars, Flag your Win and Death Race were the most appealing events of the whole fest. Adding to the events were the illuminating workshops which helped us whet our technical skills. Apart from the technical events Concetto provided an opportunity for budding entrepreneurs to display their skills. Lectures by a few imminent and distinguished speakers imparted insightful knowledge and profound experience to us.</p>
              <p>As a cherry on cake was the string of informal events. The EDM night was the perfect place to unwind after an exhausting streak of three days. The event was full of exuberance and memories for me. The fiesta was spot on an amalgamation of science, technology and entertainment making it go around the moon.</p>

              <h1>DPS Experience</h1>
              <p>A team of some senior members from the Robotics and AI Club organised a workshop at DPS Bokaro on the 19th and 20th January 2018. The workshop covered some basic topics of Manual as well as Autonomous Robotics.</p>
              <p>
                The students were introduced to line-follower robots, their applications in real life and were explained the concepts behind the working of a line follower robot. They were introduced to the world of Autonomous Robotics and learnt about the Arduino Microcontroller and its functioning. A complete tutorial to build a line follower robot was demonstrated and kits containing all the robotic components were distributed. Students also got the opportunity of hands-on experience as they went on to build the line-follower bots, right from scratch, under the guidance of our experienced club members.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the second day of the workshop, a project exhibition was organised and some very exciting and innovative projects were presented before the students where they learnt some real world applications of science. After the project showcase, the students were introduced to the game of Robo-soccer. They enjoyed watching some of their classmates dribbling and kicking the ball in the soccer arena using some of our specialized Soccer Robots.

              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, it was a very captivating workshop filled with lots of learnings, science, zest of friendly competition with loads and loads of fun.
